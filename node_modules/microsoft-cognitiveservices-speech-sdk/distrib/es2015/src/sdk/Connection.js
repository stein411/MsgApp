 * Connection is a proxy class for managing connection to the speech service of the specified Recognizer.
 * By default, a Recognizer autonomously manages connection to service when needed.
 * The Connection class provides additional methods for users to explicitly open or close a connection and
 * to subscribe to connection status changes.
 * The use of Connection is optional, and mainly for scenarios where fine tuning of application
 * behavior based on connection status is needed. Users can optionally call Open() to manually set up a connection
 * in advance before starting recognition on the Recognizer associated with this Connection.
 * If the Recognizer needs to connect or disconnect to service, it will
 * setup or shutdown the connection independently. In this case the Connection will be notified by change of connection
 * status via Connected/Disconnected events.
 * Added in version 1.2.0.
